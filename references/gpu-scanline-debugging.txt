All files that ALTER gpu.scanline;

display.c: refers and calls it, but doesn't change it at any point

gpu.c:
	line 60: gpu.scanline++
	line 63: gpu.scanline = 0

	line 97: gpu.scanline++
		^^^called during hblank() function

memory.c: only calls it as a return value for when address == 0xff44


All files that CALL hblank();

gpu.c:
	line 43: hblank();

gpu.scanline is used identically to Cinoop. Therefore, the difference must be in how the sections that alter the scanline are called. These sections are all within the GPU.c function stepGPU.

stepGPU is called EVERY frame. Each frame, gpu.tick is updated with the difference between the current tick value and the tick value last frame. Then, depending on the GPU state/mode & the ticks, it may call hblank or vblank.

From testing, the gpu modes seem to be switching correctly. So it must be something to do with the ticks?

IVE JUST WORKED OUT THAT MY TICK COUNT IS OFF BY 3 EVERY LOOP AFTER 0x214 -> 0x215 -> 0x216.
SOMETHING MUST BE GOING ON HERE!

From what I can see, I am 30% behind what I should be by the time I hit 0x219. no$gba has 0xff44 at 0x0D, while mine is at 0x0A.
